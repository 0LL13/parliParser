# parliParser
A parser to convert to text and parse parliament speeches that had been saved in PDF
The idea behind this project was to easily find parts in speeches of Members of Parliament about topics of your choice. Like what did MoP say about tax increase
or education or climate change. Just enter a word or an expression and the parser would find any sentence that contains that word or expression. You could also
chose if you want the sentence before and after, or two sentences before and after, to provide some meaningful context.
